/*
 * Organizing interfaces into a header file
 * 
 * C provides poor support for separating interfaces
 * from implementations. The best a programmer can do is
 * put each interface in a .h file and use the
 * C preprocessor to [[#include]] those .h files where
 * they are needed. Ensuring that the right files are
 * [[#include]]'d, that they are [[#include]]'d in the
 * right order, and that no file is [[#include]]'d more
 * than once are all up to the programmer; the
 * C language and preprocessor don't help. These
 * problems are common, and C programmers have developed
 * conventions to deal with them, but these conventions
 * are better suited to large software projects than to
 * small interpreters. I have therefore chosen simply to
 * put all the interfaces into one header file, all.h.
 * When Noweb extracts code from the book, it
 * automatically puts [[#include "all.h"]] at the
 * beginning of each C file.
 * 
 * File all.h, which includes all interfaces used in the
 * interpreter, is split into these parts:
 * 
 *  \tightlist
 *   ‚Ä¢ Imports of header files from the standard
 *  C library
 *   ‚Ä¢ Type definitions
 *   ‚Ä¢ Structure definitions
 *   ‚Ä¢ Function prototypes
 *   ‚Ä¢ Arcana used in lexical analysis and parsing
 * 
 * Putting types, structures, and functions in that
 * order makes it easy for functions or structures
 * declared in one interface to use types defined in
 * another. And because declarations and definitions of
 * types always precede the function prototypes that use
 * those types, I need not worry about getting things in
 * the right order.
 * 
 * \qbreak To make it possible to reuse the
 * general-purpose interfaces in multiple interpreters,
 * the definitions and prototypes are split into two
 * groups: shared and unshared. A definition is
 * ``shared'' if it is used in another interpreter.

 * Streams
 *

 * a lot going on:
 * 
 *   ‚Ä¢ Each [[XDef]] is produced from a parenthesized
 *  phrase, for example something like \monobox(val n
 *  0) or \monobox(define id (x) x). A parenthesized
 *  phrase, which in the code is called [[Par]], is
 *  simply a fragment of the input in which
 *  parentheses are balanced; converting a
 *  parenthesized phrase to an expression or an
 *  extended definition is the job of the parser
 *  presented in \crefcparse.chap. Producing
 *  parenthesized phrases, however, is done here;
 *  function [[parstream]] produces a stream of
 *  [[Par]]s, called [[Parstream]], and [[getpar]]
 *  takes a [[Parstream]] and produces a [[Par]].
 *   ‚Ä¢ A [[Par]] is found on one or more input lines.
 *  (And an input line may contain more than one
 *  [[Par]].) A [[Parstream]] is produced from a
 *  [[Linestream]], and a [[Linestream]] may be
 *  produced either from a string or from an input
 *  file.
 * 
 * Each stream follows the same pattern: there are one
 * or more functions to create streams, and there's a
 * function to get a thing from a stream. Their
 * implementations are also similar. All the streams and
 * their implementations are presented in this section.
 * I present streams of lines first, then parenthesized
 * phrases, and finally extended definitions. That way,

 * and I'm too stubborn to change.] The [[getline_]]
 * function prints a prompt, reads the next line of

 * line. Client code needn't worry about how long the
 * line is; [[getline_]] allocates enough memory to hold
 * it. Because [[getline_]] reuses the same memory to
 * hold successive lines, it is an unchecked run-time
 * error to retain a pointer returned by [[getline_]]

 * [*] When it encounters a fault, the Impcore

 *  by calling [[synerror]].
 *   ‚Ä¢ When it detects an ill-behaved program at run
 *  time, the interpreter signals a run-time error by
 *  calling [[runerror]].
 * 
 * Before initiating error recovery, each
 * error-signaling function prints a message. For that
 * reason, an error-signaling function's interface
 * resembles [[print]]. But because different
 * information is available at parse time and at run
 * time, [[synerror]] and [[runerror]] have different
 * interfaces.
 *

 * Unicode support
 * 
 * Unicode is a standard that attempts to describe all
 * the world's character sets. In Unicode, each
 * character is described by a ``code point,'' which is
 * an unsigned integer. Example code points include
 * ``capital A'' (code point 65) and ``capital √Ö with a
 * circle over it'' (code point 197). Most character
 * sets fit in the Basic Multilingual Plane, whose code
 * points can be expressed as 16-bit unsigned integers.
 * 
 * UTF-8 stands for ``Unicode Transfer Format
 * (8 bits).'' UTF-8 is a variable-length binary code in
 * which each 16-bit code point is coded as a one-byte,
 * two-byte, or three-byte UTF-8 sequence. The coding of
 * code points with values up to 65535 is as follows:
 * 
 *   hex         binary                   UTF-8 binary
 *   0000-007F   00000000 0abcdefg   =>   0abcdefg

 *   0800-FFFF   abcdefgh ijklmnop   =>   1110abcd 10efghij 10klmnop
 * 
 *   010000-001FFFFF:      11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

 * sequences: often one byte, almost always two.
