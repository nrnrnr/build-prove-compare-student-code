 * Structure and invariants of the evaluator
 * 
 * As in \crefimpcore.chap,scheme.chap, the main
 * judgment of the operational semantics‚Äîthe state
 * transition <e/v,rho,sigma,S> \STEPS<e'/v', rho', 
 * sigma', S'>‚Äîis implemented by function [[eval]]. This
 * function starts with an expression e and an empty
 * stack S, and it repeats the transition until the
 * current item is a value v and the stack is once again
 * empty. Then it returns v. Function [[eval]]'s
 * essential invariants are as follows:
 * 
 *   ‚Ä¢ The environment rho is always in [[env]] and the
 *  stack is always in [[evalstack]]. As part of the
 *  state transition, these variables are mutated in
 *  place to hold rho' and S', respectively.
 *   ‚Ä¢ When the stack is not empty, the youngest frame
 *  (the ``top'') is pointed to by local variable
 *  [[fr]] (for ``frame'').
 *   ‚Ä¢ When the current item is an expression e, that
 *  expression is stored in argument [[e]], and the
 *  state transition begins at label [[exp]].
 *   ‚Ä¢ When the current item is a value v, that value is
 *  stored in local variable [[v]], and the state
 *  transition begins at label [[value]].
 *   ‚Ä¢ Each state transition ends with \monoboxgoto exp
 *  or \monoboxgoto value. Before the goto, either
 *  [[e]] or [[v]] is set to the current item for the
 *  next state. Variables [[env]] and [[evalstack]]
 *  are also set.
